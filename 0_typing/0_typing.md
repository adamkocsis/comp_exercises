# Exercise 0. Learning how to touch type

It is very difficult to think about programming and solving difficult, abstract problems when you have a problem finding letters on the keyboard. Accomplished programmers know how to use their keyboard.

This exercise has a dual purpose: 

1. You will establish a habit to practice touch typing, which should be beneficial for any kind of professional work.
2. We will generate a dataset that allows you to practice working with text-based data formats. You will also have nice, familiar dataset that you can use to try different statistical analyses.


# Instructions

1. Create an account on http://keybr.com
2. Follow the instructions - change language if you like! Use your native language, if you can!
3. Practice every day for about ~5 minutes)
4. After each practice, record what you have done in the csv structure that I included in progress.csv. You can find the relevant information about today's practice if you click on the profile tab on the right. The following data should be recorded:

`year`: The current year - make the dataset consistent

`month`: The current month 

`day`: The current day

`time`: Time spent practicing today. Record this in seconds!

`lessons`: The number of text samples you worked on (no. of sample texts)

`top_wpm`: Your top wpm for today

`average_wpm`: Your average wpm for today

`num_letters`: The number of characters practiced (green in the bar above the practice area)

(in contrast to what I said before, the number of errors not here, so we won't record those)

5. Keep a separate git directory for this file and commit the changes that you make to make it a habit.
6. Create a private github respository for this repository and push your changes to it.

We will use these csv data for basics of data analysis.


# Requirements for the course

The requirement of the course is to have at least 50 days practiced until Feb. 8, 2022 (preferrably every day!). 
The people that have the highest number of practiced days and most time spent practicing will get a piece of chocolate :).
I will be doing this too.
