# Exercise 31: calculations based on separate subsets

Subset definitions (as in the previous exercise) are useful, because they can be automated with loops.

## Instructions

Write a script that contains code to do the following tasks:

1. Calculate how many islands are occupied by every penguin species! 
The output object will be a vector with a numeric value for *every species*!

2. Calculate the mean bill length on *every island*! 

3. Calculate the number penguin species found on *every island*!


## Hints
The most transparent way of doing these is to write for loops that iterate the calculation for every thing that you calculate on (e.g. look for 'every' such as in 'every species'). If you find simpler solutions, that's even better!
All of these can also be calculated with 'tapply()' loops. Try to do those as well!
