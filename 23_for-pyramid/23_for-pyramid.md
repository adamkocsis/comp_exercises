# Exercise 23: For loop - number pyramid

# Instructions
- Write a for-loop to print the following information to the console 
```R
1
12
123
1234
12345
123456
1234567
12345678
123456789
```


(use `message()`, check out what `message(6:9)` does!)

- Write the body of this function
```R
pyramid <- function(n){

}
```

that would display the pyramid until the nth row, so `pyramid(4)` would return:
```R
1
12
123
1234
```
