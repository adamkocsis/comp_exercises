# Exercise 20: Simple vector subscripts

Look at this vector
```R
prices <- c(8, 6, 7, 1.1, 6, 3, 4, 5)
names(prices) <- c("icecream", "cup", "stick", "water", "lollypop", "chips", "flour", "sugar")
```

## Questions:
- How would you write numeric subscripts to get the 4th, 5th, and 7th values in a vector? 
- Who would you do it with a logical subscript?
- How would you do it with a character subscript (names)?
