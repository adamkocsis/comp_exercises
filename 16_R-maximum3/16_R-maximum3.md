# Exercise 16. Maximum of three values

## Instructions
- This exercise is the same as No. 15, with the exception that the function will be able to take three values (`a`, `b` and `c`).

Similarly to `max2()`, this can be done with a combination of if-else blocks.

It should be callable like this:
```R
max3(a,b,c)

```

- Testing is important.
- Make sure to test the function you have written with some examples. 
- Try to find corner cases, where you expect the function behavior to change.
