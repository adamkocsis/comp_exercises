# Exercise 7: The path environmental variable

## Instructions

0. Make sure that R is installed on your computer (both 64 and 32-bit)!

1. Locate the 64-bit binary executable files of R and note their path!

2. Add this path to the system-wide (the bottom white box, not the top one!) path environmental variables!

3. Prove that R is on the path by running

``` bash
Rscript --version
```

from different directories using git bash!
