# Exercise 14: Functions with if

## Instructions
1. Look at the following R code that we used in the class:

```R
value <- FALSE
if(value){
    message("The value is TRUE.")
}else{
    message("The value is FALSE.")
}
```

2. Write a function from this code to make this executable with a single line of code. The function should take a single argument `value`.
