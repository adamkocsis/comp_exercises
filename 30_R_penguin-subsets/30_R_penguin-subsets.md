# Exercise 30: Getting subsets of the penguin data

Getting simple subsets is an important part of data analyses. These subsets are based on combinations of logical expressions. 

## Instructions

Write a script that stores the following subsets as individual objects
0. Get the palmer penguin dataset into R! (in any way you want to)
1. Separate all penguins (create a subset) that come from Torgersen island! How many penguin specimens were found there? 
2. Separate the data from all penguins that are found on Biscoe Island and belong to the Adelie species!
3. Make a subset of the penguins that have a flipper length which is lager than 190 mm! How many are there?
4. How many female penguins were caught after 2008? (2008 included) 
5. Calculate the number of penguins that have larger flippers than 210mm! How many species do these belong to?
