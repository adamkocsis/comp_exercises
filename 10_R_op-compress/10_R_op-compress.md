# Exercise 10: Order of operations - compression


## Problem
In this directory, there are several scripts that include multiple lines to calculate a value.
These scripts all can be compressed quite a lot.  

## Instructions
1. Your task is to shorten these scripts and express what each of them does by one line of code!

2. Create a new git repo directory in exercises to store the output, and commit the exercise scripts too!

3. You can save all of the solutions to a single file. Just make sure to use comments to indicate which exercise is which.

4. After each example, commit the file so you can store how this file itself changes.
