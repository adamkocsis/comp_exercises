# Exercise 18: Factorials

Factorials (denoted as n! in maths), are important part of combinatorics and probability theory.

These behave like this
```
0! = 1 (exception)
1! = 1
2! = 1 * 2
3! = 1 * 2 * 3
4! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4
...
n! = 1 * 2 * ... * n
```

Factorials are also not used for negative numbers.

## Instructions

Using your newfound knowledge of `if()` statments and `while()` loops, write a function `fact(n)` that calculates n!

## Hints
- you have to use ifs for 0 and negative values
- the number of iterations is related to n.
- R has a builtin function to do just this (`factorial()`). You can use this to compare your function's results!

- This is the hardest assignment so far, but don't give up! :)
