# Exercise 11: Using the trigonometric functions

## Instructions
Use the basic trigonometric functions `sin` `cos` and `tan` to calculate the following *mathematical* expressions.
Write a script file that prints the results of these calculations.

- sin(60°)
- cos(35°)
- tan(10°)
- sin(260°)
- cos(27°)

## Notes
Note that trigonometrics functions require the input values in radians and not degrees, so you have to figure out (remember) how to change these into radians.
