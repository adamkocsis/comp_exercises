# 6. Practice with git

This exercise depends on exercise 5.

## Instructions

1. Create a new directory `git_fossils` in the exercises directory!

2. Initialize an empty git repository in this directory!

3. Copy the contents of the `fossil_dir` into this directory (`fossil_dir` itself should not be copied!). You can use `cp -r` to copy entire directories!

4. Stage and commit everything in this directory! 

5. Create a new file `bats.txt` in the `Chiroptera` directory and add this single link in it:
`https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Onychonycteris_finneyi_Fossil_Butte_National_Monument.jpg/1920px-Onychonycteris_finneyi_Fossil_Butte_National_Monument.jpg`

(without the primes).

6. Use the `wget` tool to download this image into the `chiroptera` directory!

7. Commit everything!

8. Create a new github repository for your fossil image and link this `git_fossils` directory to it!

9. Push everything to github!
