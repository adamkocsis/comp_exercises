# 5. More practice with the directories and git bash

## Instructions

### 1. Extend the fossil directory tree with the following additions using BASH commands!

    exercises
       fossil_dir
           vertebrates
	           mammals
		           Monotremata
			       Theria
			            Marsupialia
				    	Placentalia
						    Chiroptera
							Artiodactylia
							Perissodactylia
							Carnivora
							Rodentia
					

Assume the same position of reference for the subdirectories, i.e. use relative paths, e.g. `mammals/Monotremata` to make new directories and record your steps in a script file (`mammal_dirs.sh`) *without* using the change directory (`cd`) command! 
Put this file into the `vertebrates` directory!

### 2. Delete everything in the mammals directory with a single line of code!

### 3. Use the `bash` command to run the script you created before to recreate the directory structure exactly as it was!
