# Exercise 26: More basic vector operations 

Look at the following vector
```R
v <- c(
	300:500,
	12:89,
	700:800
)
```

# Questions: 
- What is the type of this vector?
- How many values are there in this vector? 
- How many odd values are there in this vector? (use %% to get remainder!, x%%2 == 1 then x is odd!)
- What is the sum of this `v` vector? Calculate that with a simple for loop!
