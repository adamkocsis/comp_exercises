# Exercise 21 - Numeric indices of logical vectors

Look at this logical vector `bRemain`

```R
oneSeq = 1:800
bRemain = oneSeq%%9 ==0
```

## Questions
- Try to express with natural language what the bRemain expresses!
- How would you get the indices at which the values are `TRUE`?
- How would you get the indices at which the values are `FALSE`? (there is a logical operator that you can use here)
- How many values are TRUE in `bRemain`?
